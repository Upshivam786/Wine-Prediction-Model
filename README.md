# 🍷 Wine Prediction Model (MLOps Demo)

An end-to-end **Machine Learning + MLOps** project demonstrating how to build a reproducible ML pipeline using **DVC**, **Google Cloud Storage**, and **MLflow**.

This project focuses on:
- Data versioning with DVC
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- Reproducible model training
- Clean GitHub repository without raw data leakage

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal is to train a **RandomForestRegressor** model to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

Key MLOps concepts implemented:
- **Dataset versioning** using DVC backed by **GCS**
- **Experiment tracking** (params, metrics) using **MLflow**
- Separation of **code** and **data**
- Reproducibility across environments

### Enhancements added in this version:
- Integrated **DVC with Google Cloud Storage** for data versioning
- Added **MLflow** for experiment tracking
- Cleaned and handled real-world data issues
- Improved reproducibility and documentation
- Structured the project as a complete **MLOps workflow**

All MLOps-related integrations, debugging, and cloud setup were implemented independently as part of hands-on learning.
